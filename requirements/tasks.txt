Master API client ID - The API client with the specified client ID will receive all orders, even those placed by other API clients. This differs from the Client ID of “0” which will receive all orders sent from the TWS GUI.


Evan S: It's better to use the master client id.
Evan S: Because by default, it will only return the commission for the order which placed via this client.
Evan S: But if you use master client id, then it will return the commission for the orders even if it's placed via TWS manually.
